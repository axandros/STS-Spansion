# STS - Spansion
A simple learning project that adds new cards, relics, and events for each base game character.
I want to figure out how to make mods and I'm documenting my process on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCunBRksyc5vzTT6tpwmu8Gw)! 
In addition, this is helping to dust off my Java language skills, which I havn't used since 2014.

## Technologies
* Java

## Tools
* IntelliJ
* Maven

## Requirements
Requires Slay the Spire's *desktop-1.0.jar*, Mod-TheSpire, and Basemod libraries in a lib/ directory at the same level as the top level directory.
> ${basedir}/../lib/*

## Project Status
Currently implementing cards for the characters.
Looking into relic design for the next step, then moving on to events.
New encounters are planned, but will not likely be done for a while.
